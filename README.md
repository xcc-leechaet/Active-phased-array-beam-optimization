# Active-phased-array-beam-optimization
Active phased array beam optimization based on genetic algorithm with a priori knowledge of beam distribution

Principle from: Separable active phased array beamforming, whose full-domain peaks can be disassembled as a result of the superposition of two vertically oriented peaks
